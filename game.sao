"A friendly tan and white dog approaches and sniffs you. She turns and walks to an empty bowl on the floor and begins tapping it with her paw."
"The dog looks at your strangely. Then taps her bowl again. It seems she would like to drink from there."
"The dog drinks the water greedily, then walks a few feet until she finds a spot to her liking. She flops over gracelessly and lets out a contented sigh."
"Lark opens the door and asks me if my key isn't working. I enter the office."
"Lark helpfully opens the door. "
"You pull on the door but it's locked. Perhaps you should try knocking?"
"Everyone looks at you... eventually Rafi walks over and opens the door."
"Oh, I might want to think twice, I just remembered this passage from the Employee Handbook:

"
"> The legal status of a controlled substances, including marijuana, shall be
> determined by federal, rather than Colorado, law. Colorado voters approved
> Amendment 20 on the 2000 November Election ballot, allowing for medical use
> of marijuana. In November 2012, Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which
> legalized the use of recreational marijuana. Neither measure requires the
> Company to accommodate the medical use or possession of marijuana in any work
> place. Likewise, the Company will not tolerate or accommodate the off-duty
> use of marijuana or any other illegal drug by employees."
"`No way bud! You're outta here!'` the employee yells as she pushes me out the door and up the stairs."
"`Are you serious?! Get out of here'` the employee yells as he pushes me toward the stairs."
"Uh oh... someone made a very poor choice on their first day."
